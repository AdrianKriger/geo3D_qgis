# *geo3DLite* (QGIS)

*geo3DLite* is a dependency-free, variant of [*geo3D*](https://github.com/AdrianKriger/geo3D) designed to run entirely within [QGIS](https://qgis.org). It focuses on spatial reasoning and interactive exploration at the village and suburb scale.

**Core Characteristics**
- QGIS-Native: No Conda, no Docker, nor external Python libraries required.
- Interactive-Only: Designed for exploratory analysis and workshops, not production.
- Local, Place-based Learning: Optimized for communities.
- Didactic: Prioritizes transparency and learning over automated production.

**Use Cases**
- Spatial literacy and computational thinking workshops.
- Local SDG indicators (population estimation, [BVPC](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-cities/articles/10.3389/frsc.2020.00037/full), rooftop solar potential).
- Low-resource or offline-only environments.

**What it is NOT**
*geo3DLite* is not a tool for generating topologically correct, semantially rich LoD1 City Models. For simulation ready (wind comfort factor, energy demand, etc.) models, you are welcome to [*geo3D*](https://github.com/AdrianKriger/geo3D)

**Requirements**
- QGIS (Current LTR recommended) with the [opengeos](https://github.com/opengeos) [QGIS Notebook Plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis_notebook/) installed.
